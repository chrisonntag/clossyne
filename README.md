</h1>

Clossyne – short for Cloud Storage System and named after Mnemosyne, the greek goddess 
of memory – is a distributed key-value storage based on binary search-tress. 
It can be easily accessed by a dictionary-based data access API and is written in Scala with the Akka framework 
incorporating the Actor model.

It allows for fast and efficient data storage and retrieval by utilizing a binary search tree structure and 
assigning each node of the tree to an individual actor.

## Installation and Usage
Please follow the README files in the respective directory for the server and the Python client.
